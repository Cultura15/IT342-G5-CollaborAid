NAME: Jhudiel Adrian B. Artezuela
COURSE & YEAR: IT-3

Hello, I'm Jhudiel but you can call me Adrian. I like to travel on a motorcycle, play video games, read manhuas, play sports and many much more. Why 
do I have a lot of hobbies? It is because of the saying I have been leaning to all my life, which is "You only live once". Knowing that means I enjoy
doing new things, and I believe this will be a great asset to my career as a IT professional.

### Short Description About Myself:
I am a chill guy who loves playing guitar, video games, and sports. One hobby of mine is that I love petting fish because it makes my mind calm and helps push away negativity. I believe that every person is born with talent, and that every event in life happens as an opportunity to choose love over fear. So rather than fearing something, I will just love and embrace it. And I thank you for reading!
