### Short Description About Myself:
I am a chill guy who loves playing guitar, video games, and sports. One hobby of mine is that I love petting fish because it makes my mind calm and helps push away negativity. I believe that every person is born with talent, and that every event in life happens as an opportunity to choose love over fear. So rather than fearing something, I will just love and embrace it. And I thank you for reading!
