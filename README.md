COURSE & YEAR: IT-3

Hello, I'm Jhudiel but you can call me Adrian. I like to travel on a motorcycle, play video games, read manhuas, play sports and many much more. Why 
do I have a lot of hobbies? It is because of the saying I have been leaning to all my life, which is "You only live once". Knowing that means I enjoy
doing new things, and I believe this will be a great asset to my career as a IT professional.
