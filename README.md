<Short description about yourself (5 sentences)>

I am a chill guy who loves playing guitar, video games and sports. One hobby of mine is that I love petting fish because it makes my mind calm and put away negativity in my thoughts. I believe that every person is born with talent and that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear, so rather than fearing something I fear, i will just love and embrace it. And I thank you!
